I've shipped production-ready builds including a VR Hunter Safety Simulator with Idaho Fish & Game which achieved <strong>2,500+ downloads</strong> on SideQuest. I have also led AR development for an interactive scavenger hunt with eight mini-games across Boise's Julia Davis Park. These projects were done while collaborating directly with stakeholders like Boise Parks and Rec and the Boise Basque Community.</p> <p>With Computer Science and GIMM degrees from Boise State University and professional experience as a Mixed Reality Developer and Software Engineer, I build gameplay systems end-to-end—realistic mechanics, AI behaviors, animation systems, and multiplayer networking. I'm currently prototyping a third-person shooter in UE5 with C++, implementing combat interactions and networked gameplay.</p> <p>Beyond development, my passion for strategic thinking and world-building extends to tabletop gaming. I'm an active member of the Warhammer club and regularly play Warhammer 40K with friends. The tactical depth and rich lore continually inspire my approach to game design, teaching me about balance, player engagement, and the creation of compelling fictional universes.</p> <p>Explore my portfolio to see shipped projects, gameplay implementations, and how I approach building engaging interactive experiences.</p>"
