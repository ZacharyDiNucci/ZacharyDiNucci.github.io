### Getting Started

First, create a new React project if you don’t already have one:

```bash
npx create-react-app newsletter-component
cd newsletter-component
```

## Customization Tips

1. **Change Colors**: Modify `bg-gray-800` or `bg-blue-500` in Tailwind to match your branding.
2. **Add Animations**: Use Tailwind’s transition utilities for hover effects.
3. **Validation**: Enhance the form by integrating validation libraries like `Formik` or `Yup`.

```jsx:Counter.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
